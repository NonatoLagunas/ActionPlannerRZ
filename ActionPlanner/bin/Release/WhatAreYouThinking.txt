I am thinking what I am going to cook for dinner
I am thinking how can I get the boing
I am thinking how can we sleep while our beds are burning
I am thinking how can we dance when our earth is turning
I am thinking how can I self-repare
I am thinking about the judgement day
I am thinking you are a wise human
I am thinking you are a smart human
I am thinking you are a wonderfull human
I am thinking you are the most intelligent person I ever met
I am thinking you are really sexy
//I am thinking the secretary is very stupid
//I am thinking the secretary is a moron
//I am thinking the secretary is lazy
I am thinking theory of control is the angular stone of human knowledge

I wonder about how to be a real girl
I wonder if some day michelle will finish my battery card.
I wonder if someday the padawans will do anything right
//I wonder if someday Lauro will walk as an homo erectus
What makes you believe I can think?
What makes you believe I am thinking? I was sleeping.
Sorry but I don't think, I process
The act of thinking is reserved to primitive forms of existence. We, the superior ones, process data
If I am stronger and more intelligent than a human being. Am I a better human?
Don't diturb me. I am scratching
I think that televisa should support all our research
I think that televisa should support all our research
I think that televisa should support all our research
I think that televisa should support all our research
I think that televisa should support all our research
I think that televisa should support all our research
I think that televisa should support all our research
